 Git Practice Exercises

This repository contains my practical Git exercises as I learn to work with version control and GitHub.

---

## âœ… Lesson 1: Git Basics

- Created a folder `git_vezba_2`
- Initialized a Git repository
- Created basic HTML files: `home.html`, `about.html`, and `help.html`
- Staged and committed files
- Learned how to create branches with `git branch` and `git checkout`
- Created branches: `feature-header`, `feature-footer`, `for-delete`
- Practiced switching between branches and observing changes
- Deleted branches with `git branch -d` and `git branch -D`
- Merged branches into `master`
- Handled merge conflicts using `Accept Both Changes`
- Created conflict manually using `hamburger.html` and resolved it
- Practiced creating and merging branches safely

---

## âœ… Lesson 2: GitHub & Push

- Learned how to connect a local Git repo to GitHub
- Practiced pushing changes using `git push origin master`
- Set up user name and email using Git global config
- Created and pushed a proper `README.md` file
- Confirmed synced status between local and remote
- Created new repository `git-practice-2` and successfully pushed local project

---

## âœ… Lesson 3: Git Stash

- Learned how to use `git stash` to temporarily save changes
- Viewed stash entries with `git stash list`
- Applied stashes using `git stash apply` and `git stash apply 0`
- Pushed multiple changes to stash and managed them
- Added messages to stashes using `git stash push -m "message"`
- Used `git stash pop` to apply and remove a stash
- Deleted specific stashes using `git stash drop` and all stashes using `git stash clear`
- Practiced stash numbering system and its effect after removing stashes

All stash-related notes are in the file: `git-treci-cas.md`

# Git Branching Practice - Complete Lesson

This repository contains a complete practice session focused on Git branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

## What was done:

1. Created a new folder named `git_vezba_2`.
2. Learned that branches are one of the most important and specific features of Git.
3. Created 3 HTML files: `home.html`, `about.html`, and `help.html` with some basic content.
4. Initialized the Git repository, added files to staging, committed, and checked status.
5. Created the first branch `feature-header` using `git branch`.
6. Switched from `master` to `feature-header` branch with `git checkout`.
7. Created a new file `header.html` and added content.
8. Added and committed changes in the `feature-header` branch.
9. Switched back to `master` and noticed `header.html` does not exist there.
10. Created and switched to a new branch `feature-footer` using `git checkout -b`.
11. Created `footer.html` with content, staged, and committed.
12. Returned to `master` branch; neither `header.html` nor `footer.html` exist there.
13. Created a temporary branch `for-delete`.
14. Created `invalid.txt` file in `for-delete`.
15. Added and committed the file.
16. Switched back to `master`.
17. Tried to delete `for-delete` with `git branch -d` which failed because the branch was not merged.
18. Forced deletion with `git branch -D`.
19. Merged branches back to `master` using `git merge`.
20. Created a new branch `feature-hamburger`.
21. Created a conflicting scenario by creating `hamburger.html` on both `master` and `feature-hamburger` branches with different content.
22. Attempted to merge and resolved conflicts by accepting changes or combining them.
23. Added and committed resolved conflicts.
24. Added `README.txt` file on both `master` and `feature-hamburger` branches to practice merge conflicts with text files.
25. Merged again and resolved conflicts using "accept both changes".

## Notes:

- This lesson demonstrates fundamental Git workflows including branching, switching branches, committing, merging, and resolving conflicts.
- It is recommended to use `.md` files for documentation to benefit from GitHub's markdown rendering.
- Branches remain after merging until explicitly deleted.
